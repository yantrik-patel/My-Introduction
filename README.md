# My-Introduction
This is the introduction about myself.  
I am actively looking for opportunities in Data Analyst or ML Engineer roles.

I was born and raised in Gujarat, India.

I graduated in 2011 with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering.

Over the years I have build my work experience from working as Procurement and SCM Analyst.

The numbers and statistics have been a part of my life from a long time. And I love to materialize the story the Data is telling and present it.

I began my career in Procurement Analytics leveraged Excel to create a material requirement planning sheet. This helped the company to plan the materials precisely. And completely eliminated duplicate and no order items upto 90%.

I moved myself to other company and worked with multination teams from USA, China and Mexico. I developed communication, problem solving and team work skills in this role and I led the team of associates. I cut down the premium price buying by 20-25% by working closely with other departments of company. I also developed dashboards to determine the buying trend and inventory level analysis in Excel.

Iâ€™m looking to pivot my career into full time Data Analytics through my technical and soft skills as I love to help companies get more value from their data.

I enjoy learning new things and always looking for something new to read or a course to take. Currently I am diving deep into Machine Learning.
